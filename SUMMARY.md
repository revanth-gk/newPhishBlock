## Core Components

### Smart Contracts
- **PhishBlock.sol**: Main contract with report management and voting system
- **Events**: ReportSubmitted, VoteCast, ReportValidated, ValidatorAdded/Removed
- **Access Control**: Admin and validator roles with modifiers
- **Core Functions**: submitReport, vote, addValidator, removeValidator, getReport

### Frontend Pages
1. **Dashboard** - Overview with statistics and quick actions
2. **Submit Report** - Form for submitting new phishing reports
3. **Validate Reports** - Interface for community voting
4. **All Reports** - Browse all reports with filtering
5. **Report Details** - Detailed view of individual reports
6. **Quick Check** - Simple verification interface
7. **Profile** - User profile with voting history

### Reusable Components
- **Web3Provider** - Wagmi and RainbowKit provider wrapper
- **ConnectWallet** - MetaMask wallet connection
- **ReportForm** - Report submission form
- **ReportList** - Report listing component
- **ReportDetails** - Detailed report view
- **VotingInterface** - Voting interface
- **QuickCheck** - Quick verification component
- **UserVotes** - User voting history
- **NavBar** - Navigation component
- **Dashboard** - Main dashboard

### Custom Hooks
- **usePhishBlock** - Hook for smart contract interaction
- **useWalletAuth** - Hook for wallet authentication

## Integration Points

### Web3 Authentication
- MetaMask wallet integration
- WalletConnect support via RainbowKit
- User authentication state management

### IPFS Storage
- Web3.Storage integration for decentralized file storage
- JSON metadata storage for detailed report information
- File upload capabilities for evidence

### Database Integration
- Supabase integration for fast queries and real-time updates
- Off-chain data synchronization with on-chain state
- Public API for external integrations

## API Routes

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/check/[target]` - Check if URL/wallet is malicious
- `GET /api/reports` - Retrieve reports (with optional status filter)
- `GET /api/reports/[id]` - Retrieve specific report
- `POST /api/reports` - Submit new report
- `PUT /api/reports/[id]` - Update report
- `POST /api/votes` - Record vote on report

## Testing Strategy
