# PhishBlock Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the PhishBlock platform, covering all aspects of the application including smart contracts, frontend components, API endpoints, and integration testing.

## Testing Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all critical user flows and edge cases
2. **Automated Testing**: Implement automated tests for regression prevention
3. **Security First**: Prioritize security testing for smart contracts and authentication
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure the application performs well under load
5. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Test on multiple browsers and devices
